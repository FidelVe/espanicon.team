              <h2>Technical and developmental projects</h2>
              <p>
                Currently we manage 2 servers focusing on running ICON related
                projects. Our main server is entirely focused on running our
                ICON node, it's an AWS EC2 t3.small instance with 2 CPU cores, 2
                Gb of RAM and 160 Gb of storage. Our secondary server is an AWS
                lightsail VPS with 4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs and 80 GB SSD. This server
                is used for several purposes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Hosting the mail server of our Team website</li>
                <li>
                  Runs 2 instance of the price bot <i>Marvin</i> to update the
                  mainnet and testnet DAEDRIC SCOREs for Hylian
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Service management and maintenance to make sure the node and
                mail server are running smoothly without downtime and web page
                development is done in-house by our team.
              </p>

              <h2>Social media projects</h2>
              <p>
                In order to expand the presence of the ICON project, is
                important for us to have a strong and positive presence around
                the web, to achieve this we are focusing on 3 specific platform:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Twitter</b>: we are actively participating in twitter with
                  the goal of constantly giving our followers and supporters the
                  most relevant and important Spanish and English news and
                  developments occurring in the ICON ecosystem and blockchain
                  universe overall. We regularly use special hashtags like
                  #ICONEnEspañol #ICXTips #ICONProject and #ICX to share news,
                  articles, bite size tips and plenty of more information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Medium</b>:We use this platform to publish more extensive
                  tutorials and articles highly relevant to the ICON project and
                  ecosystem.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Telegram</b>:Telegram is a very important platform for ICON
                  because it provides a real time interaction between ICONist
                  and P-Reps from all over the world. Because of this we have a
                  strong presence in several Telegram channels to help ICONist
                  with questions they may have, share news and articles and help
                  moderate some of the channels.
